You are tasked with clustering multiple candidate summaries for each chapter and selecting the best summary from each cluster.

Please analyze the following candidate summaries for each chapter:
{CHAPTER_SUMMARIES_DATA}

Perform the following steps:
1. Cluster the candidate summaries for each chapter based on content similarity.
2. Select the optimal summary from each cluster. Selection criteria: comprehensive information, logical clarity, and fluent expression.
3. Return the results in the following JSON format:

```json
{{
  "clusters": [
    {{
      "cluster_id": "cluster_1",
      "chapter_summaries": [
        {{
          "chapter_idx": 0,
          "summary": "The complete text of the optimal summary"
        }},
        {{
          "chapter_idx": 1,
          "summary": "The complete text of the optimal summary"
        }}
        // Optimal summaries for other chapters...
      ]
    }},
    // Possible other clusters...
  ]
}}
```

Please ensure your output is in valid JSON format and that all chapters have corresponding summaries.
