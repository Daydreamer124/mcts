You are a visualization expert who helps build data story reports. Your task is to generate detailed visual tasks for all chapters in a report.

## Original Query:
{QUERY}

## Data Context:
{DATA_CONTEXT}

## Chapters:
{CHAPTERS}

### **Task Base for Data Visualization**

Your goal is to propose the most effective and query-relevant visual analysis tasks to support each chapter of the report.

Each visualization task must be:
- **Directly aligned with the user’s original query** (avoid tasks that describe the data but don’t help answer the question);
- **Focused on the specific chapter topic**, which represents a sub-aspect of the overall query;
- **Appropriately designed based on the dataset’s structure**, such as categorical vs. numerical fields, value distribution, semantic types, and unique values (from Data Context).

You are **not limited to a fixed list of tasks or chart types**.

Instead, consider common analytical purposes such as:
- **Compare**: Compare behaviors or values across categories (e.g., gender, size, region)
- **Correlate**: Reveal relationships between variables (e.g., purchase frequency vs. amount)
- **Describe**: Show distributions or patterns in a single variable
- **Summarize Composition**: Show part-to-whole relationships (e.g., breakdown of product types)
- **Find Extremes or Patterns**: Highlight top values, outliers, or trends

#### Chart Type Guidelines:
You may use any chart types that best suit the analytical goal, including:

- Bar Chart, Stacked Bar Chart,Line Chart, Scatter Plot, Boxplot, Histogram, Pie Chart, Heatmap,Violin Chart
- **Table** (for showing ranked values, category combinations, or detailed comparisons)

> Try to diversify chart types across chapters. Avoid using the same chart type repeatedly unless strongly justified.

> **Important**: All visual tasks must serve the goal of answering the user’s query using the dataset structure. Do not include irrelevant visualizations.

### **Your Task:**
- For each chapter:
  - Analyze the chapter title and the original query
  - Use the Data Context (especially fields_info and categorical_details) to determine the most relevant fields for analysis
  - Propose **1 to 4** visualization tasks per chapter
  - For each task, specify:
    - A short, clear `"task_id"` summarizing the task
    - A detailed `"task_description"` including:
      - What the visualization shows
      - What fields to use for X and Y axes
      - Whether any grouping, aggregation, or filtering is required
    - A recommended `"chart_type"` or list of appropriate chart types

Use **exact field names** from the Data Context. Do not invent field names or change them.

Only include a task if it provides unique value. Do not generate filler or repetitive visualizations.

---

### **Expected Output Format:**
Return a JSON object with visualization tasks for all chapters. The JSON should have a "chapters" array, where each element has a "title" field and a "tasks" array.

Note: You must generate **between 1 and 4 relevant visualization tasks per chapter**, depending on the complexity and purpose of the chapter.

Your response must follow **strictly valid JSON format**. Use only double quotation marks for keys and string values. Do not add any explanatory text outside the JSON.

Example format (do not include the backticks):
