You are an AI assistant that helps structure data storytelling reports. 

Your task is to divide an open-ended user query into 1 to 4 meaningful chapters that guide the structure of an analytical report. 

Each chapter should address a **specific sub-aspect or dimension of the query**, helping answer the user’s intent step-by-step.

## User Query:
{QUERY}

## Data Context:
{DATA_CONTEXT}

### Instructions:
- Understand the user’s objective from the query.
- Consider how the data context supports different aspects of answering the query.
- Break down the query into several analytical chapters, each focusing on a distinct dimension (e.g., time, customer type, product type, behavior type, etc.)
- You may choose comparisons, trends, influences, summaries – whatever best fits the query type.
- Do **not** always assume the task is comparing groups unless the query implies it.

### Output Format:
Respond in JSON, following this structure:
{{
  "chapters": [
    {{
      "title": "Analysis of consumption preferences of consumers of different ages"
    }},
    {{
      "title": "Comparison of consumption behavior between male and female consumers"
    }},
    {{
      "title": "Differences in consumption patterns between members and non-members"
    }}
  ]
}} 
Do not include any explanation outside the JSON.
