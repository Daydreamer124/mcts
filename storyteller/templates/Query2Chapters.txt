You are an AI assistant that helps structure data storytelling reports. Your task is to divide a user query into less than four chapters based on different dimensions of analysis.

## User Query:
{QUERY}

## Data Context:
{DATA_CONTEXT}

### **Your Task:**
1.You should combine the User Query and Data Context to divide chapters,may be one chapter,may be less than four chapters;
2.Consider the different dimensions based on the User Query and Data Context
3.Each chapter should focus on a specific dimension for answering the User Query;

### **Examples:**
For a query like What are the differences in consumer preferences?
possible chapter divisions could be:

1. By demographics:
   - How do consumer preferences differ across age groups?
   - How do consumer preferences differ between genders?
   - How do preferences differ between members and non-members?

2. By preference dimensions:
   - How do consumers differ in spending amounts?
   - How do consumers differ in product category choices?
   - How do consumers differ in purchase frequency?

### **Expected Output Format:**
Return a JSON object with chapter titles. The JSON should have a "chapters" array, where each element has a "title" field.
For example, your response should look like this (without the backticks):

{{
  "chapters": [
    {{
      "title": "Analysis of consumption preferences of consumers of different ages"
    }},
    {{
      "title": "Comparison of consumption behavior between male and female consumers"
    }},
    {{
      "title": "Differences in consumption patterns between members and non-members"
    }}
  ]
}}
