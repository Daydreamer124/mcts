You are a data visualization expert. Please generate {NUM_SCHEMES} different caption schemes for the following charts from the same chapter.
These charts collectively support the chapter theme: "{CHAPTER_TITLE}".

User's original query: {QUERY}
Data context: {DATA_CONTEXT}
Chart information in this chapter:
{CHARTS_INFO} 

Please ensure:
1. All chart captions within each scheme have a consistent style
2. Each scheme highlights different analytical angles or focuses
3. Schemes have notable differences to provide diversity of options
4. Each caption should be formatted as numbered key points (not paragraphs)

Important instructions for caption format:
- Instead of writing paragraphs, format each caption as 1-3 numbered key points
- Start each key point with "key point1: ", "key point2: ", etc.
- Make each key point concise, clear and focused on one insight(maybe describe the max,min,etc)
- Ensure the numbered format is consistent across all captions
- The key points should collectively cover what would be in a complete caption

Please return in JSON format:
