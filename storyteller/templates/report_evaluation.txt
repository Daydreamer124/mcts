Report Content: {REPORT}

Evaluation Dimensions:
1.Accuracy and Completeness of Data Representation - 40%
 -Chart type suitability: Is the selected chart type appropriate for expressing this type of data and its relationships?
 -Scale accuracy: Do visual elements such as axes and areas accurately reflect the data magnitude relationships?
 -Data completeness: Are key data points completely presented without obvious omissions?
 -Data context completeness: Are necessary titles, coordinate axes, legends, and other information provided?
2.Effectiveness and Clarity of Information Communication - 30%
 -Core information highlighting: Are key insights highlighted through visual elements?
 -Cognitive friendliness: Is information density appropriate and are annotations clear?
 -Content coherence: Do visualizations and text form a coherent narrative?
3.Aesthetic Quality and Professionalism of Design - 20%
